# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
# the `each` method is really useful because it cuts down a lot of time when you have to iterate the same thing across every element in an array. In an array with 100+ elements, it would take forever to code out an iterative code line/block for each element individually.


- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
# I definitely need to keep working my syntax and commit it to memory. I will work on this by practicing and practicing. I also need to focus on taking my time and trying to get things right the first time, rather than speeding through and having to undo/reset what I just did.

- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
# The video definitely helped me get an understanding of the .each function. Taking the assignmenet chunk by chunk helped me to get through the whole thing fairly quickly and accurately.
